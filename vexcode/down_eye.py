def near_object():
    """
    Down Eye sensor near object
    Returns if the Down Eye sensor is close enough to an object to detect a color.

    down_eye.near_object()

    How To Use
    The down_eye.near_object() command returns a Boolean value. It returns True when the Down Eye sensor is close to an object that has detectable colors, for example, a Disk. It returns False when the Down Eye sensor isnâ€™t close enough to an object with detectable colors.

    down_eye.near_object() will not detect the Playground floor as an object, but does detect colors (with the exception of pen drawings) on the Playground floor.

    down_eye.near_object() can be assigned to variables, be used in Boolean statements, or be used in other commands that take Boolean values as a parameter.

    Example
    In this project, the down_eye.near_object() command is used as a Boolean statement.If the down_eye.near_object() command returns True, the Drivetrain will stop, Near a Disk will be printed to the Monitor Console, and the project will stop.If the down_eye.near_object() command returns False, Not Near a Disk will be continuously printed on new lines.

    while True:
            drivetrain.drive(FORWARD)
            if down_eye.near_object(): 
                drivetrain.stop()
                brain.print("Near a Disk")
                stop_project()

            else:
                brain.print("Not Near a Disk")
                brain.new_line()
            wait(5,MSEC)
    A wait command needs to be used with loops.

def detect(COLOR: Color):
    """
    Down Eye sensor color
    Returns the specific color detected by the Down Eye sensor.

    down_eye.detect(COLOR)

    How To Use
    The down_eye.detect(RED) command returns a Boolean value. It returns True when the Down Eye sensor detects the selected color.It returns False when the Down Eye sensor detects a color different from the one selected.

    Choose the color for the Down Eye sensor to detect:

    NONE
    RED
    GREEN
    BLUE
    down_eye.detect(RED) can be assigned to variables, be used in Boolean statements, or be used in other commands that take Boolean values as a parameter.

    Example
    In this project, the down_eye.detect(GREEN) command is used as a Boolean statement. If the down_eye.detect(GREEN) command returns True, Green will be printed to the Monitor Console. If the down_eye.detect(GREEN) command returns False, Not Green will be displayed in the Monitor Console.

    while True:
            drivetrain.drive(FORWARD)
            if down_eye.near_object(): 
                drivetrain.stop()
                if down_eye.detect(GREEN):
                    brain.print("Green")

                else:
                    brain.print("Not Green")
                stop_project()

            else:
                brain.print("Not Near an Object")

def brightness(PERCENT):
    """
    Down Eye sensor brightness
    Returns the brightness of an object.

    down_eye.brightness(PERCENT)

    How To Use
    The down_eye.brightness(PERCENT) command returns a numerical value between 0 and 100. It returns a value in percent. White objects will report a brightness of 100%, black objects will report a brightness of 0%. All other colors will report a brightness somewhere between that range of values.

    down_eye.brightness(PERCENT) can be assigned to variables, be used in Boolean expressions, or be used in other commands that take numerical values as a parameter.
